  == Outgoing relationships

  Outgoing relationships can be of two types:

  - “Parent” relationship.
    Known as “domain” in ISO 704 and as “broader” relation in SKOS.

  - Generic sibling relationship.

  Changing *outgoing concept relationships* is possible via the Relationships panel.

  NOTE: Concept relationships are not currently part of Change Request flow.
  Currently, only register manager can edit concept relationships.

  == Incoming relationships

  *Incoming concept relationships* are tracked by the software automatically.

  For example, it is not necessary to specify “narrower” relationships:
  all concepts that specify given concept A as a parent
  are automatically considered as “narrower” concepts of concept A.

  Same applies for generic sibling relationships:
  if concept B is linked as related to concept A,
  concept A will be shown as _linked by_ from concept B.

  The Relationships panel shows incoming relationships in read-only mode.
  To edit an incoming relationship to A from B, go to the linked concept B
  and edit its outgoing relations to A.
