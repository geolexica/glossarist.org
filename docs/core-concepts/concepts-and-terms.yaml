title: "Concepts & terms"

contents: |

  In Glossarist, concepts are treated as units of understanding,
  and terms (designations) act as designated “shortcuts” to those units.

  The properties of a concept are:

  - Definition in each supported language
  - Notes and examples
  - Domain (field of knowledge, treated as “parent” concept)
  - Relationships to sibling concepts

  The properties of a term are:

  - Grammatical traits footnote:[As of now, only verbal designations are supported.]
  - Usage context information (e.g., geographical area)
  - Normative status

  A given concept can have more than one term. Generally, one term is the preferred designation,
  while others act as synonyms or abbreviations.
