title: Concept system as a register

importance: 5

summary: |
  Glossarist treats concept system as an ISO/TC 211 _register_,
  where each _register item_ represents a concept.

  The idea behind treating concept systems as registers is to benefit from standardized workflows
  for managing standardized data.

  == Participant roles

  A person working with Glossarist’s concept system would generally fall into one of the following categories:

  - *Register manager*
  +
  Person or entity responsible for handling and reviewing change requests.
  An external group of experts (control body) can be involved in the decision,
  but that is not currently handled by Glossarist.

  - *Contributor* (submitter)
  +
  Organizations or person who proposes changes to concept defintions and accepted terms.

  - *Register user*
  +
  People who are looking for accepted terms or their meaning,
  such as readers or authors of standards and specifications.

  - *Registry manager* footnote:[Note the difference between “register” and “registry”.
    The former refers to conceptual data;
    the latter to systems used to store and access that data.]
  +
  The entity tasked with maintaining the infrastructure on which register data is stored

  == Change request workflow

  To ensure reliable state of data, edits made to concepts and terms are reviewed by register manager.

  . A contributor is able to edit concepts or terms, and group their updates into a _change request_.
  . Change request is reviewed by concept system manager and potentially accepted.
  . Manager’s acceptance of a proposed revision creates a new record in concept’s _revision history_.
