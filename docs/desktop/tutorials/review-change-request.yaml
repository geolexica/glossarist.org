  == Selecting a revision to review

  . Navigate to Review module

  . Using Change Requests panel on the left,
    select a change request you want to review

  . Using Proposed Revisions panel on the right,
    select a proposed concept entry revision to review


  == Reviewing changes

  Selected concept entry will be shown in the main module view.

  You can switch between viewing _revision with changes highlighted_
  and _final revision_ using buttons in the toolbar on the bottom.


  == Accepting a revision

  If you are satisfied with the proposal, you can click the Accept Revision button.

  If an entirely new concept is being proposed, you must specify a unique numeric ID.

  .Troubleshooting
  [NOTE]
  ====
  If the “Accept revision” button is disabled, this may be caused by the following:

  * You are not listed in register roles as register manager.
  * The change request in question has not been submitted yet.
  ====


  == Updating Change Request stage

  When you are finished reviewing a CR and accepting revisions,
  you can change CR stage to Resolved or Rejected.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Glossarist Desktop does not automatically advance CR stage when you accept revisions,
  and it does not strictly enforce the stage based on whether revisions were accepted.

  In other words, it is up to you to mark the CR as Resolved or Rejected.

  If you accepted only _some_ of the proposed changes,
  you can use either status Resolved or Rejected in accordance with your
  or your organization’s policies.
