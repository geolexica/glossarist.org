  Behind the scenes, Glossarist stores concepts & terms as YAML files,
  and maintains the history of changes using Git decentralized version control system.

  The easiest way to set up the requisite infrastructure is by using Github.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Using your own Git server as Glossarist data backend is possible,
  since Glossarist does not make assumptions beyond the fact that you
  use a Git server with HTTPS basic authentication.

  However, that may change, and using other Git servers besides Github
  is not yet covered in this documentation.

  . If you don’t have a GitHub account yet,
    navigate to https://github.com/[github.com] and sign up (it’s free).

  . On Github, open the link:https://github.com/glossarist/basic-concept-registry-template[Glossarist concept system template repository],
    and create a new repository from this template (see “Use this template” button).

  . After you create your new repository, edit the following files using Github.com interface
    and enter details relevant to your concept system: `register.yaml` and `roles.yaml`.

  . Take note of your repository URL
    in the form of `\https://github.com/<your username>/<your repository name>`:
    concept system users will need to enter it into the Glossarist Desktop app on their computers.
