  == Initial settings

  On first launch, Glossarist will ask you to specify some necessary settings.

  After you fill all of them in, press “Save All” button below.

  - *Repository URL:* this should be provided by registry manager who
    link:https://www.glossarist.org/docs/adopt/2-infrastructure/[set up the infrastructure] for you.
  +
  NOTE: Make sure that the URL is in the correct format. It should start with “https://”.

  - *Git username:* this is the username you chose when signing up for GitHub.

  - *Git author name:* specify your name. This is important, as it will show on edits you make.

  - *Git author email:* specify your relevant work email.
    This is even more important, as it identifies your edits and change requests as yours.

  After you save the settings, the initial settings window will close.

  == Password

  Before the app can access register data, it will ask for your password.
  Specify your GitHub account password (unless you have second-factor authentication enabled).

  NOTE: If you have enabled the second-factor authentication on GitHub,
  you will need to provide your Personal Access Token instead of your password.
  https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token[Learn how to create this token.]
  When creating the token, enable _public_repo_ scope (“Access public repositories”).

  NOTE: On Ubuntu Linux, the app will ask for Git password on every launch. This is a known issue
  (https://github.com/glossarist/glossarist-desktop/issues/129[#129]).

  == Initial synchronization

  Once you have provided settings and password, the app will start downloading register data.
  This may take a minute.
  After this completes, the “Ready” message should appear. You can dismiss it.
