  == Selecting a revision to review

  . Navigate to Review module

  . Using Change Requests panel on the left,
    select a change request you want to review

  . Using Proposed Revisions panel on the right,
    select a proposed concept entry revision to review


  == Reviewing changes

  Selected concept entry will be shown in the main module view.

  You can switch between viewing _revision with changes highlighted_
  and _final revision_ using buttons in the toolbar on the bottom.


  == Accepting a revision

  If you are satisfied with the proposal, give the new concept an ID
  and click Accept revision.

  NOTE: You must choose a unique numeric ID.

  NOTE: Change Request status is not affected by accepting revisions.
  (See below.)

  [NOTE]
  ====
  If the “Accept revision” button is disabled, this may be caused by the following:

  * You are not listed in register roles as register manager.
  * The change request in question is not in “Submitted” state.
  ====


  == Updating Change Request stage

  When you are finished reviewing a CR and accepting revisions,
  you can change CR stage to Resolved or Rejected.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The application does not enforce the stage.

  If you accepted only some of the proposed changes,
  it is up to you and the policies of the organization whether to mark
  the CR as Resolved or Rejected.
