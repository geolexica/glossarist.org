  Glossarist’s approach is a bit more involved compared to ad-hoc concept bookkeeping.

  == Concepts and designations

  Treat terms as “shortcut” designations for _concepts_, and concepts as units of understanding.
  footnote:[For details, read link:../../core-concepts/intro-to-concept-systems[intro to concept systems]
  and link:../../core-concepts/concepts-and-terms[“Concepts & terms”].]

  - A concept is assigned a definition, notes and examples.
  - A term is associated with certain grammatical traits
    and respective normative statuses.

  === Normative status of a term

  Since multiple terms can be used to represent a particular concept
  and language in any field constantly evolves,
  a Glossarist term is marked as “preferred”, “admitted” or “deprecated”
  (in order of decreasing preference).

  == Change workflow

  Glossarist’s concept database is treated as a register,
  and updates to concepts or terms are handled through the change request workflow.

  Submitters will need to _request changes_, and register manager will need to review and accept them.
  footnote:[For details, refer to link:../../core-concepts/registers[“Concept system as a register”].]

  == Desktop software for editing data

  Managing concept systems (proposing changes and reviewing changes) is done using Glossarist Desktop.
  It is expected that you will use this software while working with the concept system register.
